# Common Voice Wiki Sentence Extractor

## Dependencies

- [Rust Nightly](https://rustup.rs/) (follow the instructions and customize the install to select nightly channel)

We need to download the wikiextractor and this script
```
git clone https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor.git
git clone https://github.com/Common-Voice/common-voice-wiki-scraper.git
```

## Usage

1. Download the latest wikipedia dataset [backup dump from Wikimedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index-bydb.html), select the one with `pages-articles-multistream` in its name.

Example (you can change "en" to your locale code)

```bash
wget https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2
bzip2 -d enwiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2
```

2. Use WikiExtractor to extract a dump (this might take a couple of hours)

```bash
cd wikiextractor
python WikiExtractor.py --json ../enwiki-latest-pages-articles-multistream.xml
```

*Important note: Please check the section about [creating a rules file](#using-language-rules) and [a blacklist](#create-a-blacklist-based-on-less-common-words) at this point, you might want to consider creating them and that process should happen before step 3.*

3. Scrap the sentences into a new file from the WikiExtractor output dir (this might take more than 6h to finish)
```bash
cd ../common-voice-wiki-scraper
cargo run --release -- extract -l english -d ../wikiextractor/text/ >> wiki.en.txt
```

*Tip: You don't need this last process to finish to start observing the output, wiki.en.txt should get a few hundred and thousands sentences in just a few minutes, and you can use that as a way to estimate the quality of the output early on and stop the process if you are not happy.*

## Using language rules

We can only extract at most 3 sentences per article.

The following rules can be configured per language. Add a `<language>.toml` file in the `rules` directory to enable a new locale.

| Name   |      Description      |  Values | Default |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|---------|
| min_trimmed_length |  Minimum length of string after trimming | integer | 3
| min_characters |  Minimum of character occurances | integer | 0
| may_end_with_colon |  If a sentence can end with a : or not | boolean | false
| quote_start_with_letter |  If a quote needs to start with a letter | boolean | true
| disallowed_symbols |  Array of disallowed symbols or letters | String Array | all symbols allowed
| disallowed_words |  Array of disallowed words | String Array | all words allowed
| broken_whitespace |  Array of broken whitespaces. This could for example disallow two spaces following eachother | String Array | all types of whitespaces allowed
| min_word_count |  Minimum number of words in a sentence | integer | 1
| max_word_count |  Maximum number of words in a sentence | integer | 14
| abbreviation_patterns |  Rust regex to match against | Rust Regex Array | all abbreviations allowed
| needs_punctuation_end |  If a sentence needs to end with a punctuation | boolean | false
| needs_letter_start |  If a sentence needs to start with a letter | boolean | true
| needs_uppercase_start |  If a sentence needs to start with an uppercase | boolean | false
| even_symbols |  Symbols that always need an event count | Char Array | []
| require_even_symbols |  If enabled any occurrences of the symbols in `even_symbols` need to be even | boolean | false

## Using disallowed words (blacklisting)

In order to increase the quality of the final output, you might want to consider filtering out some words that are complex, too long or non-native.

You can do this by adding these words to the language rules file for your language under the disallowed_words setting.

If your list of too long, you can also place a `<language>.txt` file in the `rules/disallowed_words` directory to enable a new locale. Each word should be in a new line.

### Create a blacklist based on less common words

You can create a solid blacklist by generating a list of the less common words from your wikipedia.

To do so, first you should create a full export with all wikipedia sentences. (Note that all processes below will take a while to execute)

After running step 1 and 2 from the Usage section above, run:

```bash
cd ../common-voice-wiki-scraper
cargo run --release -- extract -d ../wikiextractor/text/ --no_check >> wiki.en.all.txt
```

Then you can use the cvtools scripts to generate a list of the word frequency

```bash
cd  ..
git clone https://github.com/dabinat/cvtools/
cd cvtools
python3 ./word_usage.py -i ../common-voice-wiki-scraper/wiki.en.all.txt >> word_usage.en.txt
```

You will have to read the ``word_usage.en.txt`` file to decide where you should put the limit. Usually words with less than 80-60 repetitions are in general bad.

```bash
grep -i "80" ./word_usage.en.txt
```

Once you know the frequency limit, you can generate your blacklist by running

```bash
python3 ./word_usage.py -i ../common-voice-wiki-scraper/wiki.en.all.txt --max-frequency 80 --show-words-only >> ../common-voice-wiki-scraper/src/rules/disallowed_words/english.txt
```

This list will be automatically used if present when you run the scrapping on step 2 from the Usage section.

## Getting your rules/blacklist incorporated

In order to get your language rules and blacklist incorporated in this repo, you will need to create a pull request explaining the following:

- How many sentences did you get at the end?
- How did you create the blacklist file?
- Get at least 3 different native speakers (ideally linguistics) to review a random sample of 100-500 sentences and estimate the average error ratio and comment (or link their comment) in the PR.

Once we have your rules into the repo, we will be able to run the extraction from our side and incorporate the sentences into Common Voice repo. But please, take note that we have limited resources and we can't guarantee a specific date for us to run this process (we are looking into automating it)
